1) Define Data Structures.
    - A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data.
    Data structures make it easy for users to access and work with the data they need in appropriate ways. 

2) Define primary data structures.
    - A primary data structure is a data structure that is created without the use of other data structures.

3) Define static data structures.
    - A static data structure is an organization or collection of data in memory that is fixed in size.

4) List some of the static data structures in C.
     - Arrays are a prominent example of a static data structure.

5) Define dynamic data structures.
   - Dynamic data structures are those whose organizational characteristics may change during their lifetime. 
    
6) List some of the dynamic data structures in C.
   - Stack,Linked List, Tree, Queue

7) Define linear data structures.
   - A linear data structure is a structure in which the elements are stored sequentially, and the elements are connected to the previous and the next element.

8) Define non-linear data structures.
   - Data structures where data elements are not arranged sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures.
    Some examples of non-linear data structures are LinkedLists, Trees and Graphs.

9) Define Linked Lists.
   - A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. 

10) Differentiate between Data and Information.
    - Data is a collection of facts, while information puts those facts into context. 
    While data is raw and unorganized, information is organized. 
    Data doesnâ€™t depend on information, while information depends on data.

11) What is abstract data type (ADT)?
    - The abstract datatype is special kind of datatype, whose behavior is defined by a set of values and set of operations.

12) Define Record and field.
    - Record: Record is a collection of values or fields of a specific entity. Eg. An employee, Salary account, etc.
    - Field: A field refers to an area within a record which is reserved for a specific piece of data. Eg. Employee ID.

13) List any four Data Structure operations.
    The possible operations on the linear data structure are: Traversal, Insertion, Deletion, Searching, Sorting and Merging.

14) Define Sorting with examples.
    - Sorting is the processing of arranging the data in ascending and descending order. 
    For example, a list of words could be sorted alphabetically or by length. 
    A list of cities could be sorted by population, by area, or by zip code.

15) What is merging?
    - Merging is the practice of taking two or more groups of data in the form of a file or folder, and combining them into a single file or folder, respectively.

16) Define complexity of Algorithms.
    - Complexity of an algorithm is a measure of the amount of time and/or space required by an algorithm for an input of a given size (n).

17) What is worst Case Efficiency?
    - Worst Case Efficiency - is the maximum number of steps that an algorithm can take for any collection of data values.

18) What is control structure and give the syntax for selection statement.
    - Control Structures can be considered as the building blocks of computer programs.
    The selection control structure allows one set of statements to be executed if a condition is true and another set of actions to be executed if a condition is false.

19) Define Algorithm.
    - An algorithm is a procedure used for solving a problem or performing a computation. 

20) What is best Case Efficiency?
   - Best case efficiency is the minimum number of steps that an algorithm can take any collection of data values.
