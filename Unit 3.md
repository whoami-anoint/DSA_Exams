1) Define Linked List.
    - A linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.

2) List the components of Linked List.
    - A linked list is made up of “nodes”. Each node has two components: an item, and a reference to the next node in the list.

3) What are the advantages of Linked lists over a Arrays? 
    - Advantages of Linked List over Array are:
    1) Dynamic Data Structure:
    2) No Memory Wastage:
    3) Implementation:
    4) Insertion and Deletion Operation:

4) Name the types of Linked Lists.
    - There are four key types of linked lists:
    a) Singly linked lists.
    b) Doubly linked lists.
    c) Circular linked lists.
    d) Circular doubly linked lists.

5) What is grounded header list?
    - Grounded header linked list that stores NULL in the last node's next field.

6) What is Header Node?
    - A header node is a special node that is found at the beginning of the list.

7) List the three applications of Linked List.
     - Three Applications of linked list are:
     a) Implementation of stacks and queues
     b) Dynamic memory allocation : We use linked list of free blocks.
     c) Maintaining directory of names

8) List any two operations of Linked Lists.
     - Two operations of Linked Lists are: 
    Insertion − Adds an element at the beginning of the list. 
    Deletion − Deletes an element at the beginning of the list.

9) Define Singly Linked List.
    - A singly linked list is a type of linked list that is unidirectional, that is, it can be traversed in only one direction from head to the last node (tail). 

10) How do you show the static representation in linked list?
     - In static representation of a single linked list, two arrays are maintained: one array for data and the other for links.

11) List any two disadvantages of Linked Lists.
     - Two Disadvantages of Linked Lists:
        a) Searching an element is costly and requires O(n) time complexity.
        b) Random access is not possible due to dynamic memory allocation.

12) Define Circularly Linked List.
     - A circular linked list is a type of linked list in which the first and the last nodes are also connected to each other to form a circle.

13) List two ways of searching a list.
     - Two ways of searching a list are: 
        a) Sequential Search
        b) Binary Search

14) Mention the function for releasing memory of node.
      - We release the allocated memory by calling the free() method whenever the node or complete linked list is no longer needed.

15) Name the Operations on Two-Way Lists.
     - Operations on doubly linked list
    Insert: adding a new node to the existing doubly linked list.
    Delete: removing a node from the existing doubly linked list.
    Search: finding a node containing the search data in the existing doubly linked list. 
    Display: display the existing doubly linked list.
