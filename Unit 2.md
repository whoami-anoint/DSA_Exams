1) Define stack.
    - Stacks in Data Structures is a linear type of data structure that follows the LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) 
    principle and allows insertion and deletion operations from one end of the stack data structure,
    that is top.

2) Define Recursion.
   - The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion 
    and the corresponding function is called a recursive function. 

3) List the types of Queue.
   - There are four different types of queues:
    a) Simple Queue
    b) Circular Queue
    c) Priority Queue
    d) Double Ended Queue

4) Define priority queue.
   - A priority queue is a special type of queue in which each element is associated with a priority value.

5) List the operations of stack.
   - Basic Operations of Stack:
    Push: Add an element to the top of a stack.
    Pop: Remove an element from the top of a stack.
    IsEmpty: Check if the stack is empty.
    IsFull: Check if the stack is full.
    Peek: Get the value of the top element without removing it.

6) What will be the position of front and rear if circular queue is empty?
    - In a circular queue, the element is always deleted from front position. 
    Check whether queue is Empty means check (front==-1). 
    Check if (front==rear) if it is true then set front=rear= -1 else check if (front==size-1),
    if it is true then set front=0 and return the element.

7) What will be the position of front and rear if circular queue is full?
   - A circular queue will be full when Front = -1 and Rear = max - 1.

8) Mention 2 real life examples of stacks.
   - Examples of stacks in "real life":
    a) The stack of trays in a cafeteria
    b) A stack of plates in a cupboard

9) List the operations of stack.
   - Basic Operations of Queue:
    Enqueue: Add an element to the end of the queue.
    Dequeue: Remove an element from the front of the queue.
    IsEmpty: Check if the queue is empty.
    IsFull: Check if the queue is full.
    Peek: Get the value of the front of the queue without removing it.

10) Define Circular Queue.
    - A Circular Queue is a special version of queue where the last element of the queue is connected
     to the first element of the queue forming a circle.

11) List any three applications of queues.
    - Three Application of Queues in Data Structure: 
    a) Handling website traffic.
    b) Routers and switches in networking.
    c) Maintaining the playlist in media players.

12) List any three applications of stack.
    - Three Application of the Stack:
    a) Stacks can be used for Backtracking, i.e., to check parenthesis matching in an expression.
    b) It can also be used to convert one form of expression to another form.
    c) It can be used for systematic Memory Management.

13) What is overflow with respect to stack?
    - A stack overflow is an undesirable condition in which a particular computer program tries to use more
    memory space than the call stack has available.

14) What is top of stack?
    - The top function returns the topmost element of the stack.

15) What is polish notation?
     - Polish notation is a notation form for expressing arithmetic, logic and algebraic equations. 

16) Define Queue underflow.
    - Queue underflow happens when trying to remove an element from an empty queue.

17) What is Dequeue? Give example.
     - Deque or Double Ended Queue is a type of queue in which insertion and removal of elements can either 
    be performed from the front or the rear. 
    For example: You need to store undo/redo operations in a word processor.

18) Expand LIFO and FIFO.
    - FIFO is an abbreviation for first in, first out.
    - LIFO is an abbreviation for Last in, first out is same as first in, last out (FILO).

19) How Insertion and deletion is performed on stack?
     - A stack is an ordered list in which all insertions and deletions are made at one end,called the top.
